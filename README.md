# web-testing

## About

A repository created for testing all kinds of fascinating web technologies and frameworks, in order to better understand them, and to experiment with [git](https://git-scm.com/). The goal is to gain more experience so I can also implement what I learn in other projects.

### Authors

## License & Usage

The code is currently not licensed, meaning you do not have permission to use, modify, or share it in any way. I will consider adding a license later.

## Contributing

### Pull Requests (PRs)

Contributions in the form of pull requests are currently discouraged as the repository exists just for my own testing and learning purposes.

### Issues

If you find a possible problem or bad practice, please submit an issue! I would like to know if you have a better way of doing it, and I would like to figure out the fix or implementation on my own.

## Donating

You don't.
